## Hi there 👋

Welcome to Pool-Box. We develop R packages and web apps to analyse pool-tested data for epidemiological studies.

### PoolTestR

❓ An R package with tools for working with pooled or grouped samples, initially inspired by the stand-alone software 'PoolScreen'

⭐ Features:
  - Facilitates estimates of prevalence of a marker in the population based on tests performed with pooled sampled
  - Perform analyses under frequentist (maximum likelihood) or Bayesian frameworks
  - Accounts for hierarchical/clustered sampling designs
  - Enables mixed effect regression models to identify covariates with the outcome of interest, estimate odds ratios, and predict prevalence
  - Estimate intra‐cluster correlation (ICC) coefficients for each variable in the hierarchical sampling scheme

💻 Visit the [PoolTestR  GitHub repository](https://github.com/AngusMcLure/PoolTestR)

💻 PoolTestR is also available for download on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PoolTestR/index.html) and [R-universe](https://angusmclure.r-universe.dev/PoolTestR)

### PoolPoweR

❓ An R package to faciliate proper study design for surveys using pool testing

⭐ Features:
  - Power and sample size calculations
  - Design optimisation tools for surveys using pool testing
  - 
💻 Visit the [PoolPoweR  GitHub repository](https://github.com/AngusMcLure/PoolPoweR)

### PoolTools

❓ A Shiny interface to PoolTestR and PoolPoweR with a user-friendly GUI

💻 The latest version of PoolTools (v0.1.5) is available here: https://poolbox.shinyapps.io/PoolTools/

💻 Visit the [PoolTools GitHub repository](https://github.com/AngusMcLure/PoolTools)

💻 PoolTools is documented via the PoolTools [wiki](https://github.com/AngusMcLure/PoolTools/wiki.)
